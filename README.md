### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**MartinKlaushofer/MartinKlaushofer** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm Martin, a PhD student in Mechanical Engineering with a focus on the intricate interplay between microstructure and mechanical properties of metals and alloys. My work is a blend of rigorous experimental testing and advanced computational simulations. I specialize in conducting tensile, low cycle fatigue (LCF), high cycle fatigue (HCF), and crack propagation tests, alongside developing finite element analysis (FEA) models in Abaqus to predict and analyze material behavior under various stress conditions.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m deeply engaged in research aimed at understanding and improving material durability and performance, utilizing both LCF, HCF testing, and crack propagation studies to assess material behavior comprehensively.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently enhancing my expertise in the FKM Guideline for lifetime assessment of large components, aiming to ensure their reliability and performance in critical applications.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about mechanical testing, FEA simulations in Abaqus, data analysis with Python in the context of material science, or any related queries in mechanical engineering.
- âš¡ Aside from my academic and research pursuits, I have a passion for photography, capturing the subtle intricacies of our environment through my lens. I also maintain an active lifestyle, frequenting the gym and practicing Judo, which help me stay balanced and focused.

I'm always open to discussing mechanical engineering, material science, and the potential impact of our work on industry and technology advancements.
